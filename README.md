# DTMF Generator/Decoder

```dial.m``` - generates a vector containing the signal of the specified tones, in addition to the time domain graph for assessment, spectral analysis and playback of the sound along with its output file ```seqDTMF.wav```.

```dial_random.m``` - generates a vector containing the signal of the specified tones plus a white noise, in addition to the time domain graph for assessment, spectral analysis and playback of the sound along with its output file ```seqrDTMF.wav```.

```decoder.m``` - returns the dialed numbers in an audio file, in addition to displaying the graph in the time domain for assessment, spectral analysis and the Fourier transform of the signal.

Each file contains a brief explanation on how to use it on Matlab and most of the code is explained.
